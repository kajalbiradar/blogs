## üîß Essential Python Tools: Navigating OS, YAML, JSON, and sys üõ†Ô∏è

**OS (os module) üñ•Ô∏è**: The `os` module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. DevOps engineers use it to perform tasks such as file and directory operations, process management, and environment variables handling. Whether it's navigating directories, checking file existence, or executing shell commands, the `os` module is a versatile tool in their arsenal.

**YAML (PyYAML) üìÑ**: YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. DevOps engineers utilize the PyYAML library to parse and generate YAML files, making configuration management and data interchange seamless. Whether configuring infrastructure or defining application settings, YAML simplifies complex structures into an easy-to-understand format.

**JSON (json module) üìã**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data interchange format. DevOps engineers often work with JSON files to exchange data between systems or configure applications. The built-in `json` module allows them to parse JSON data and convert it to Python objects, facilitating efficient data manipulation and transformation.

**sys (sys module) üß∞**: The `sys` module provides access to Python interpreter-specific functionalities. DevOps engineers leverage it for tasks like manipulating Python paths, interacting with the runtime environment, and handling command-line arguments. It gives them control over the behavior of the Python interpreter and allows them to fine-tune their scripts and applications.

DevOps engineers rely on these essential Python tools to seamlessly interact with the operating system, manage configurations, exchange data, and fine-tune their scripts for optimal performance and functionality.

## Tasks:

### 1\. Create a Dictionary in Python and write it to a json File.

```python
import json

# Create a dictionary
data = {
    "name": "Kajal Biradar",
    "age": 23,
    "city": "Mumbai",
    "skills": ["Python", "DevOps", "AWS"]
}

# Define the file path
file_path = "data.json"

# Write the dictionary to a JSON file
with open(file_path, "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)

print("Dictionary written to JSON file successfully!")
```

In this example, we import the `json` module, create a dictionary called `data`, and define the file path as `"data.json"`. Then, we use the `json.dump()` function to write the contents of the dictionary to the specified JSON file.

### **2\. Read a json file** [`services.json`](https://github.com/kajalbiradar/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day15/services.json) **kept in this folder and print the service names of every cloud service provider.**

To read the [`services.json`](https://github.com/kajalbiradar/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day15/services.json) file and print the service names of every cloud service provider, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import json

# Define the file path
file_path = "services.json"

# Read the JSON file
with open(file_path, "r") as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)

# Print the service names of every cloud service provider
for provider, service_data in data["services"].items():
    if provider != "debug":
        print(f"Cloud Service Provider: {provider.upper()}, Service Name: {service_data['name']}")
```

In this code:

1. We import the `json` module to work with JSON data in Python.
    
2. The `file_path` variable stores the path to the `services.json` file.
    
3. We use the `open()` function to open the JSON file in read mode (`"r"`).
    
4. We use the `json.load()` function to parse the JSON data from the file into a Python dictionary, which is stored in the `data` variable.
    
5. The `for` loop iterates through each item in the "services" dictionary.
    
6. We check if the provider name is not equal to "debug" (as specified in the JSON data), to exclude the debug key.
    
7. If the provider is not "debug", we print the name of the cloud service provider (converted to uppercase) and its corresponding service name from the JSON data.
    

The code will print the service names of each cloud service provider present in the `services.json` file.

### 3\. Read YAML file using python, file [`services.yaml`](https://github.com/kajalbiradar/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day15/services.yaml) and read the contents to convert yaml to json

To read a YAML file using Python and convert its contents to JSON, you can use the `pyyaml` library, which provides functionalities to work with YAML data. First, make sure you have installed the `pyyaml` library. If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

Once you have installed the `pyyaml` library, you can use the following Python code to read the [`services.yaml`](https://github.com/kajalbiradar/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day15/services.yaml) file and convert its contents to JSON:

```python
import yaml
import json

# Define the file path
file_path = "services.yaml"

# Read the YAML file
with open(file_path, "r") as yaml_file:
    data = yaml.safe_load(yaml_file)

# Convert YAML data to JSON
json_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4)

# Print the JSON data
print(json_data)
```

In this code:

1. We import the `yaml` and `json` modules.
    
2. We define the file path as `"services.yaml"`.
    
3. We use the [`yaml.safe`](http://yaml.safe)`_load()` function to read the YAML file and load its contents into a Python dictionary.
    
4. We then use `json.dumps()` to convert the Python dictionary (`data`) to a JSON-formatted string, storing it in the `json_data` variable.
    
5. Finally, we print the JSON data, which represents the contents of the original YAML file converted to JSON format.
