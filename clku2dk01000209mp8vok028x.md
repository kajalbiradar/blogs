## 🌟 **Introduction** 🌟

Welcome to the fascinating world of Git, the version control system that empowers developers worldwide! 🚀 In this blog, we'll explore some fundamental Git features and understand how they come to life with real-life examples. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting, understanding these Git concepts will boost your productivity and make collaboration a breeze. Let's dive right in!

## 🔒 **Git Stash**

**Definition:** Git Stash is a feature in Git that allows developers to temporarily store changes they are working on without committing them. It acts like a 🗄️ "hidden shelf" where you can store your modifications when you need to switch branches or pull in updates without committing unfinished work. Stashing is useful when you want to save your progress but are not ready to commit the changes yet.

Example: Let's say you are working on a new feature in your project, and suddenly, an urgent bug report comes in. You need to switch to the bug-fix branch immediately and address the issue. However, your feature is not complete yet, and you don't want to commit half-done work. In this situation, you can use Git Stash to save your changes temporarily. After fixing the bug and committing the fix, you can switch back to your feature branch, unstash your changes, and continue working seamlessly. 🏃‍♂️💻

## 🍒 **Cherry-pick**

**Definition:** Cherry-pick is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another branch. It enables you to choose specific changes, independent of the branch history, and incorporate them into your codebase. Cherry-picking is useful when you want to bring specific features, bug fixes, or improvements from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

Example: Imagine you are working on a software project with multiple branches for different features. One of your teammates has implemented a critical security fix in their feature branch. The fix is essential and needs to be included in the main development branch. Instead of merging the entire feature branch, which may have other changes not yet ready for production, you can cherry-pick the commit containing the security fix and apply it to the main branch. This way, you selectively bring in the crucial change without introducing other untested code. 🍒✨

## 🔄 **How to Resolve Merge Conflicts?**

Let's say you and your teammate are working on different parts of the same project. When you both try to merge your changes into the main branch, Git detects conflicting changes in a common file. For example, you both made modifications to the website's header section. Git marks the conflicting lines, and now it's up to you to resolve the conflict. By reviewing the changes, discussing with your teammate, and merging the differences appropriately, you can harmonize the conflicting changes and ensure a smooth integration of your work. Git's conflict resolution empowers teamwork, preventing code clashes and maintaining code quality.

## **📋 Task 1: Stashing**

Step 1: Create a new branch and make some changes to it.🌿

Step 2: Use git stash to save the changes without committing them.🔄

Step 3: Switch to a different branch, make some changes, and commit them. 🌿

Now, you have switched back to the `main` branch, made some changes, and committed them.

Step 4: 🔄 Use `git stash pop` to bring back the changes and apply them on top of the new commits. 🌟

Now, the changes you made to "stash.txt" on the 🌱 dev branch are reapplied on top of the new commits you made on the 🚀 main branch. If there are any conflicts between the changes from the stash and the changes from the main branch, Git will notify you, and you'll need to resolve those conflicts manually.

That's it! You've successfully used `git stash` and `git stash pop` to save and reapply changes across different branches without committing them immediately. These Git stash commands can be incredibly handy when you need to switch between tasks or branches temporarily without losing your changes. 👌

## 📋 Task 2: Rebase 🔄

In this task, we'll be working on the 📅 day-10 version01.txt file in the 🌱 development branch and carrying out a rebase operation. Follow these steps:

📝 Open the version01.txt file in the 🌱 development branch. Add the line: "After bug fixing, this is the new feature with minor alteration."

Commit this change with the message: "Added feature2.1 in development branch."

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690999358540/ec21fa88-aafc-4d4c-9b21-99503c0ec68d.png align="center")

📝 Add another line in version01.txt: "This is the advancement of the previous feature."

Commit this change with the message: "Added feature2.2 in development branch."

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690999398237/5f5f5666-14e4-4b1f-93cb-2158d3f78e23.png align="center")

📝 Add one more line in version01.txt: "Feature 2 is completed and ready for release."

Commit this change with the message: "Feature2 completed."

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690999429515/73317f7e-3480-4c2d-8f68-1c4943d9300b.png align="center")

🚀 Create the 📦 prod branch and use git rebase to include all the commits from the 🌱 dev branch into the 📦 prod branch.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690999508856/94f1ea05-0e06-414c-8793-3ccc90cb654f.png align="center")

## 📋 **Task-03: Cherry-picking** 🍒

In this task, we'll venture into the 📦 `Production` branch, cherry-pick the commit " Added feature2.2 in development branch," and infuse it with new energy. Let's proceed with enthusiasm:

🍒 Cherry-pick the "Added feature2.2 in development branch" commit into the `Production` branch.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690999724427/619db95a-1620-4ad0-a9b4-9d8f79b6e52f.png align="center")

  
📝 Add this line after "This is the advancement of the previous feature": Line4&gt;&gt; Added few more changes to make it more optimized."

Commit these fine-tuned improvements with a message: "Optimized the feature."

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690999822226/f959e210-06fb-4722-b795-aeb655a83f98.png align="center")

  
You've achieved a feat of cherry-picking and optimization! 🌟 The `Production` branch now bears the fruits of your labor. Congratulations on a job well done! 🎉
